            <p>The Swift Alps is an experimental conference, as stated in the website. The question is: why?</p>
            What is the reason to experiment in the conference space? My goal for this post is to clarify
            everything.<br />
        </div>

            <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
            <p>There are many reasons to try something new in the conference space, some of these reasons are problems
                speakers
                and attendees are facing
                at every event which are:</p>

            <h3>Back to the routine</h3>
            <p>After the conference has ended, it is very common to get back to the office, fire the code editor, try
                some new
                stuff and… just forget about it after a week.
                All the new coolness just learned during the last event has been completely lost. Sometimes it could
                also happen
                that with a co-worker we are able to try something new for longer, but it’s usually only a single idea
                that gets
                adopted, forgetting the others N things learned during the conference. Experimenting and failing is part
                of our
                daily job, sometimes we have zero time, sometimes we have a little bit more, but <b>experimenting is the
                        first step
                        for adoption</b> and during regular confs it’s hard to do it.</p>

            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <p>We usually collaborate only with our co-workers and rarely, with people we don’t know personally over an
                Open
                Source project, but still, most of the time is just us and the code. In a classic conference the code on
                the
                screen seems interesting in a first place, but right after the talk is over, it’s unlikely to remember
                it for
                further usage. <b>Again, the coolness of the conference has been pretty much forgotten.</b></p>

            <h3>Socialization</h3>
            <p>Socializing is an important part of a conference, for some people is the main reason to go to a
                conference, but
                the chances to socialize are limited to breaks and after-party.
                I never saw anybody starting a random-chat while somebody else was on stage presenting something, <b>this
                        is
                        generally rude</b>. What I also never saw is a couple of attendees socializing in front of a screen talking
                about a
                piece of code, which sounds strange, considering we spend 6–8 hours of our daily job time in front of a
                screen.
            </p>

            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>Learning is a complicated process, we go trough many steps while learning something. The current
                conference model
                makes learning hard, listening to somebody on a stage
                is a small step, because the result is usually resume like “I just got aware of something cool”, leaving
                in
                front a lot of steps, but… how do we learn something? <b>Usually failing, while experimenting.</b>
                Failure is part of our daily routine, we: code, fail, learn, fix, do it again. From other attendees we
                can learn
                a lot, most of the times we work with other people which we already know, sharing failures and learning
                together. How many times we work with an absolute stranger who can teach us something new and cool or,
                on
                opposite, which we can teach something new? <b>Rarely.</b></p>

            <h2>The Alps</h2>
            <p>This event is about <b>community</b>. Period. The major goal is to experiment with the Swift programming language
                with all
                the other attendees, trying to learn, while failing, as much as possible.
                Ash Furrow wrote two amazing pieces about <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/normalizing-struggle/">Normalizing Struggle</a> and later about <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/empathetic-civilization/">Empathetic Civilization</a>,
                which are
                two great readings for somebody interested in joining us for this event. Both these articles are summarizing
                what
                <b>The Swift Alps</b> wants to tackle and what is going to be as event.</p>
            
            <h2>The Format</h2>
            <p>The format has been developed by many people, collaborating in a single document, trying to get the best of
                    other
                    formats like hackathons and un-conferences. What is the results?
                    As you might have seen in the <a href="index.html">official website</a> there are already some mentors (not speakers!) listed. These
                    mentors
                    are going to be an important part of the event, but the most important one is going to be the attendee —
                    you!</p>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            The introduction is going to be a 5–7 minutes presentation from the mentors about a topic to run experiments
            (examples: cross-platform Swift, server side Swift, testing, security, extensions, asynchronous programming,
            etc…),
            every attendee can then understand what the group is about and later join it for experiments.
            ￼
            <img src="img/concept/intro.png" class="py-2 img-fluid" role="presentation" />
            
            <h3 class="py-2">Experimenting</h3>
            <p>Every mentor is going to have a group of people, experimenting on the topic they prepared, maybe with a
                    final goal
                    in mind (examples: sample web app, Android app in Swift, fix of tedious bug in a widely used OS library,
                    Swift
                    Evolution Proposal, etc…), but they might also be totally open (bring your own bug). All the attendees are
                    going to
                    work with other people they probably never worked with, exchanging knowledge while normalizing the struggle.
                    We’ll
                    shake things up regularly and have 3–4 sessions with eachother. <b>What you will bring back home goes far
                            beyond what
                            you bring back home from a regular conference.</b></p>
            ￼
            <img src="img/concept/experimenting.png" class="py-2 img-fluid" role="presentation" />
            
            <h3 class="py-2">Broadcasting</h3>
            <p><b>Hacking is important, broadcasting knowledge even more.</b> One mentor is going to be dedicated to help
                attendees
                interested in presenting what they have done during the day to all the other attendees in a fire-talk, a 5
                minutes
                technical presentation about a topic, which are going to take place at the end of day (day 1 and 2).</p>
            ￼
            <img src="img/concept/broadcasting.png" class="py-2 img-fluid" role="presentation" />
            
            <h3 class="py-2">Socialize</h3>
            The day after the conference, we will organize social events, considering the location some options are
            going to
            likely be: hiking, culture visits, wine tasting, SPA, etc.. all these social events are going to be used to
            talk
            about what just learned and how the future of Swift looks like.
            
            <h2 class="py-2">TL;DR</h2>
            The format is basically the following things combined: best of confs + best of un-confs + best of hackatons
            = The
            Swift Alps.

            <h2 class="py-2">Status</h2>
            <p>We already have dates, which means we also have an amazing venue! On the official website there’s a link to
                    reserve
                    tickets. We are also working hard to give an extra option for transportation, which is going to be cheaper
                    than
                    public transportation, from the closest major airport: Geneva. We believe that also the journey from the
                    airport to
                    the town where the event will take place has to be part of the experience of the Alps.</p>
            
            <p>For accommodation we have the plan to open a dedicated forum to discuss potential solutions, also to
                    encourage
                    sharing a chalet/apartment with other attendees whenever is possible.</p>
            
            <p>We will release all the final details as soon as possible, with the complete list of mentors, so stay tuned, <b>we are
                    working hard for this event!</b></p>
